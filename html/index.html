        Hello this is a paragraph.<br>
         A paragraph is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.<br>
        A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language,
        paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
